                    <h3> Extra curricular acctivities</h3>
                    <p>I worked as student before and I plan to continue working alongside my studies. In my spare time I like to play PC games, hang out with girlfriend / fiends, code something, learning new things, workout, play on the guitar.</p>
                    <p> I plan to combine it with my studies by putting school and studies on the top of my TODO list and also by not doing every activity i mentioned above when i don't have the time on them.  </p>
