                  <span class="tab"></span>In this blog I would like to show what was going on in my head when I choose this study program. What was I thinking while I was choosing the school the city and the profession.</p>
                  <p class="blogParagraph">
                    <span class="tab"></span>Since the high school I knew that I want to be a programmer. I knew that I have some hidden talent for that even though I was not completely sure. While I was looking on the other universities in my home country I noticed that many of them are mainly focused on the theoretical site of the programming which wasn't bad but it was not my style of learning.
                  </p>

                  <p class="blogParagraph">
                    <span class="tab"></span>Then I started to look at universities in the foreign countries and I found out that the Netherlands have universities which are called universities of applied sciences hence I do the research about the universities and I found out that they are mainly focused on the practical form of learning. Then I started to do more expensive research about them. I found that many of them offer international programs. Which are tough in English. Since I have a pretty good knowledge of this language I wasn't afraid and I took the challenge. </p>

                  <p class="blogParagraph">
                    <span class="tab"></span>Now the question was, which university should I choose? I wanted to study in smaller city and in the smaller university. Because I do not like crowded places. As I mentioned I liked computer science. While I was doing the research I found out about the University of Applied Sciences in the Middelburg which was offering international computer science program. I was looking Add the curriculum and I found out that. They are offering many practical work as well as the subjects I am interested in. </p>
                  <p class="blogParagraph">
                    <span class="tab"></span>In the conclusion, I found the this school is pretty suitable for me the morning, but also in the way of teaching us how to be a good part of a team and how to be a better versions of ourselves. </p>
