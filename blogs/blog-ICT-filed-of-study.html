                  <span class="tab"></span>I was always wondering how does computer programs come to life. Therefore I choose that I 
                  want to be software engineer with focus on graphical programming or app development. 
                  Until now I have no idea for what company I would like to work, hence I made a research on job market which company offers positions I would like to work at. 
                  So let’s check them out.</p>
                  <p class="blogParagraph">
                    <span class="tab"></span>I have decided what I want to do in the future. I want to create programs that will make people ask how did they do that. 
                    Mainly I want to be so called graphical programmer. With the aim of creating game engines. But I don’t mind programming other things as well. 
                    As long as it doesn’t have anything to do with designing things although I am not the worst designer. 
                    The languages I am so far interested in are C++ and C#(or .NET development in general).
                  </p>

                  <p class="blogParagraph">
                    <span class="tab"></span>I did a research and I found 3 companies that I would like to work for. Let’s dive deeper into that and discover what they have to offer.
                  </p>

                  <p class="blogParagraph">
                    <span class="tab"></span><b>As first company I have chosen is From Software, inc.</b> This company is focused on creating video games. 
                    And their biggest titles are Dark Souls (I,II,III), Sekiro: Shadows die twice, Bloodborn, Elden Ring… 
                    They are offering various kind of jobs from environment designer to business consultant. I was most interested in position called Game engine developer.
                     Unfortunately the are located in Japan (Tokyo) and they want you to learn and use Japanese.
                    Which is big red flag for me because I would never move to the Tokyo. 
                    But I have mentioned this company as an example hence, this is the kind of company that I would love to work for. Not only because it offers the position I am interested in but also it have created my favorite video games.
                  </p>
                  <p class="blogParagraph">
                    <span class="tab"></span><b>The second company is called Rockstar Games</b>.This company is also a giant in the video gaming industry with most popular titles as Grand Theft Auto series or Red Dead Redemption. 
                    As a big corporate company it offers plenty big variety of jobs. For example game designer, animation artist, sound engineer, programmer etc. 
                    The position I was most interested in is Graphics Programmer. They are using technology such as OpenGl, Vulkan, DirectX… As language for this position the have chosen C/C++.  Their studios are located all over the world but I would like to move to the Canada and work in one of studios located in that country	. 
                    The thing I like most about this company is their approach to the employees in the way that they can give you an opportunity to work with them nevertheless your experience.
                  </p>

                  <p class="blogParagraph">
                    <span class="tab"></span><b>As the third and last company I choose Dell, Inc.</b> This company is best known for their hardware rather than software. 
                    But besides laptops, monitors and desktop computers they are also developing applications which are focused on controlling your hardware for example application Dell power management manages your laptop performance, charging, battery usage etc.
                     Their applications are created in .NET environment using mainly C#. As big corporate company they are offering almost every job you can thing off from fields such as business, software development, electronics engineering and many others.
                    I was interested in position called “.NET C# software engineer” as I am really enjoying this language. The company is also employee friendly because they are offering many benefits for example remote working, private health care, sick days, company gym and more.  The thing I like most about this company is that their applications are written in C# and they are also offering  remote working environment.
                  </p>

                  <p class="blogParagraph">
                    <span class="tab"></span>In conclusion I would like to work in filed of video games focusing on graphical programming. Using language C++ or C#. And I also don’t mind writing applications in .NET environment as I have some positive experience with that. 
                    I don’t know how to describe it but I really like to be buried in the code not in the HTML or CSS typee  of code.
